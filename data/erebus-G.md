Double check to ensure the transfer of tokens is allowed. The lines [YieldBox.sol#L310](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L310) and [YieldBox.sol#L322](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L322) do exactly the same, thus it cost gas unnecessarily. Remove the one in line 322 (the second one)
