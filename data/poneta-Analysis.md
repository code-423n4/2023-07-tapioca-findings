## About the Code:
The documentation was precise and really helpful in understanding the working of the protocol,Â 

The comments before each function were also very helpful but they were inconsistent, having more comments would make the understanding of the code much more faster and smoother experience.

While going through the code, I discovered that a lot of gas can be saved by the protocol by making simple changes ( for eg:- in a lot of places, instead of using require statements, custom errors could be used). Given the size of the code, these small changes will make a big impact on the gas costs incurred. I would definitely encourage making these changes.

## My Approach:
I read the documentation, ran static analyzers on the code and then verified the findings made by the static analyzer to my understanding, I jumped right into reading the code after that.
At the end, I compiled my findings and submitted them one-by-one before writing this analysis report.
ThankYou!
