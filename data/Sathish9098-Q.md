## [L-1] Addressing the Danger of ``minAmountOut`` Set at 0: Ensuring Slippage Protection in Token Swaps

### Impact

The parameter ``minAmountOut`` assumes a pivotal role in the token swapping process, primarily functioning as a safeguard against ``potential slippage-induced`` losses for the user. However, there exists a concerning scenario wherein the user ``inadvertently`` assigns a value of ``0`` to the ``minAmountOut`` parameter.

This susceptibility exposes the user to an alarming vulnerability, whereby they become susceptible to severe financial losses stemming from manipulative activities such as ``MEV bot sandwich attacks``. 

### POC

```solidity
FILE: tapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol

 function buyCollateral(
        address from,
        uint256 borrowAmount,
        uint256 supplyAmount,
        uint256 minAmountOut, //@audit without check vulnerable to MEV attacks
        ISwapper swapper,
        bytes calldata dexData
    ) external notPaused solvent(from) returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        require(penrose.swappers(swapper), "SGL: Invalid swapper");

        // Let this fail first to save gas:
        uint256 supplyShare = yieldBox.toShare(assetId, supplyAmount, true);
        if (supplyShare > 0) {
            yieldBox.transfer(from, address(swapper), assetId, supplyShare);
        }

        uint256 borrowShare;
        (, borrowShare) = _borrow(from, address(swapper), borrowAmount);

        ISwapper.SwapData memory swapData = swapper.buildSwapData(
            assetId,
            collateralId,
            0,
            supplyShare + borrowShare,
            true,
            true
        );

        uint256 collateralShare;
        (amountOut, collateralShare) = swapper.swap(
            swapData,
            minAmountOut,
            from,
            dexData
        );
        require(amountOut >= minAmountOut, "SGL: not enough");

        _allowedBorrow(from, collateralShare);
        _addCollateral(from, from, false, 0, collateralShare);
    }

### Recommended Mitigation
Add the checks to ``minAmountOut`` value

```solidity
Require(minAmountOut > 0 , " Minout not zero");

```

##

## [L-2] Lack of checks-effects-interactions (CEI) when transfer 

### Impact

``Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)`` is a crucial principle in smart contract development that helps ensure the proper order of operations and prevents reentrancy vulnerabilities. Some of the contracts not followed the ``CEI`` Pattern vulnerable to reentrancy attacks

```

### Recommended Mitigation
Change code as per ``CEI`` Pattern

##

## [L-3] Add to blacklist function

As stated in the project:

```
Tapioca ERC20/ERC721 contracts uses the LayerZero OFTv2 and ONFT721 contracts.

```
NFT thefts have increased recently, so with the addition of hacked NFTs to the platform, NFTs can be converted into liquidity. To prevent this, I recommend adding the blacklist function.

Marketplaces such as Opensea have a blacklist feature that will not list NFTs that have been reported theft, NFT projects such as Manifold have blacklist functions in their smart contracts.

Here is the project example; Manifold

```solidity

Manifold Contract https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4e4003afe3765aca8149a82fc064c0b125b9e5a#code

     modifier nonBlacklistRequired(address extension) {
         require(!_blacklistedExtensions.contains(extension), "Extension blacklisted");
         _;
     }

```

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add to Blacklist function and modifier.

## 

## [L-4] ``forceSuccess`` parameter is ``set`` to ``false``, and the ``.call`` function fails for any of the market contracts, then creates unexpected behavior  

### Impact
The low level calls like .call return values must be checked . If we not checked return status we don't know the outcome of .call functions. 

- The contract could lose funds. If the function that is being called transfers funds, and the .call return value is not checked, then the contract could lose funds

- If the function that is being called fails, and the .call return value is not checked, then the contract could be rendered unusable. This could prevent users from interacting with the contract, or it could prevent the contract from performing its intended functions

### POC
```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstapioca-bar-audit/contracts/Penrose.sol

function executeMarketFn(
        address[] calldata mc,
        bytes[] memory data,
        bool forceSuccess
    )
        external
        onlyOwner
        notPaused
        returns (bool[] memory success, bytes[] memory result)
    {
        uint256 len = mc.length;
        success = new bool[](len);
        result = new bytes[](len);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; ) {
            require(
                isSingularityMasterContractRegistered[
                    masterContractOf[mc[i]]
                ] || isBigBangMasterContractRegistered[masterContractOf[mc[i]]],
                "Penrose: MC not registered"
            );
            (success[i], result[i]) = mc[i].call(data[i]);
            if (forceSuccess) {
                require(success[i], _getRevertMsg(result[i]));
            }
            ++i;
        }
    }

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/Penrose.sol#L424-L450

### Recommended Mitigation
This code will now ensure that the ``.call`` function succeeds for all of the market contracts, regardless of the value of the ``forceSuccess`` parameter
 
##

## [L-5] There is a risk that the ``borrowOpeningFee``,``totalBorrowCap ``,``poolFee `` variables is accidentally initialized to 0 and platform loses money

### Impact
The lack of MIN and MAX value checks in setter functions when assigning values to uint256 can be a security risk. This is because it allows users to set values that are outside of the valid range for uint256. This could lead to a number of problems, including

### POC

```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/Market.sol

function setBorrowOpeningFee(uint256 _val) external onlyOwner {
        require(_val <= FEE_PRECISION, "Market: not valid");
        emit LogBorrowingFee(borrowOpeningFee, _val);
        borrowOpeningFee = _val;
    }

function setBorrowCap(uint256 _cap) external notPaused onlyOwner {
        emit LogBorrowCapUpdated(totalBorrowCap, _cap);
        totalBorrowCap = _cap;
    }

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L142-L154

```solidity
FILE: tapioca-periph-audit/contracts/Swapper/UniswapV3Swapper.sol

61: function setPoolFee(uint24 _newFee) external onlyOwner {
62:        emit PoolFee(poolFee, _newFee);
63:        poolFee = _newFee;
64:    }

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/023751a4e987cf7c203ab25d3abba58f7344f213/contracts/Swapper/UniswapV3Swapper.sol#L61-L64

### Recommended Mitigation
Add ``MIN`` and ``MAX``, ``>0`` value checks to setter functions to avid unexpected behavior 

##

## [L-6] ``maxLiquidatorReward``,``minLiquidatorReward`` check not allow exact value. <=,>= should be used instead of ``<,>``

### Impact
The ``maxLiquidatorReward`` and ``minLiquidatorReward`` variables in the ``Market.sol`` contract do not allow exact values. This is because the require() statements that check the values use the < and > operators. These operators will not allow the values to be equal to the specified value.

```
/// @notice min % a liquidator can receive in rewards
    uint256 public minLiquidatorReward = 1e3;

/// @notice max % a liquidator can receive in rewards
uint256 public maxLiquidatorReward = 1e4; 

```

So as per protocol docs should accept the values are equal to ``minLiquidatorReward ``,``maxLiquidatorReward ``. But current require check only allow less than and greater than values. 

### POC
```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/Market.sol

212: require(
                _minLiquidatorReward < maxLiquidatorReward,
                "Market: not valid"
            );

221: require(
                _maxLiquidatorReward > minLiquidatorReward,
                "Market: not valid"
            );

``` 
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L221

### Recommended Mitigation
``require()`` statements to use the <= and >= operators, the maxLiquidatorReward and minLiquidatorReward variables will be able to allow exact values

##

## [L-7] There is no clear docs why ``<=`` and ``<`` when checking FEE_PRECISION `` _callerFee <= FEE_PRECISION`` and ``_liquidationBonusAmount < FEE_PRECISION`` 

### Impact
The disparity in using <= and < for certain checks in the documentation is not adequately explained and may cause confusion for developers. Some checks utilize <=, while others use <, without providing a clear rationale for the distinction between the two comparison operators.Using different operators for similar checks without proper documentation can lead to misunderstandings and errors in the contract's behavior

### POC

```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/Market.sol

193: require(_callerFee <= FEE_PRECISION, "Market: not valid");
198: require(_protocolFee <= FEE_PRECISION, "Market: not valid");
203: require(
                _liquidationBonusAmount < FEE_PRECISION,
                "Market: not valid"
            );
211: require(_minLiquidatorReward < FEE_PRECISION, "Market: not valid");

```

### Recommended Mitigation
Clearly document why < and <= in different places 

##

## [L-8] ``val != paused `` check could be a problem if the market needs to be ``paused`` or ``unpaused`` for a short period of time

### Impact
The ``updatePause()`` function in the ``Market.sol`` contract requires that the new paused state be different from the current paused state. This means that the function cannot be used to simply toggle the paused state.
This could be a problem if the market needs to be paused or unpaused for a short period of time. For example, if the market needs to be paused to perform maintenance, then the updatePause() function would not be able to be used to simply toggle the paused state. Instead, the function would have to be called twice, once to pause the market and once to unpause the market

### POC
```solidity
FILE: tapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/Market.sol

function updatePause(bool val) external {
        require(msg.sender == conservator, "Market: unauthorized");
        require(val != paused, "Market: same state");
        emit PausedUpdated(paused, val);
        paused = val;
    }

```

##

## [L-9] ``computeTVLInfo()``function does not handle the case where the ``collateralAmountInAsset`` variable is zero 

### Impact
This could happen if the user's collateral is worth less than the amount they have borrowed. In this case, the function would return incorrect values

### POC

```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/Market.sol

318: uint256 collateralAmountInAsset = _computeMaxBorrowableAmount(
            user,
            _exchangeRate
        );

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L318

### Recommended Mitigation
Handle the case where the ``collateralAmountInAsset`` variable is zero. This would help to ensure that correct values are returned in all cases.

## 

## [L-10] Unnecessary or unused return values ``updated, rate`` in updateExchangeRate() function

### Impact
The return values (updated, rate) from the ``updateExchangeRate()`` function are unnecessary and not being used in the calling function. Since the solvent modifier does not use the return values, there is no need to return them from the ``updateExchangeRate()`` function.

```solidity
FILE: tapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/Market.sol

function updateExchangeRate() public returns (bool updated, uint256 rate) {
        (updated, rate) = oracle.get("");

        if (updated) {
            require(rate > 0, "Market: invalid rate");
            exchangeRate = rate;
            emit LogExchangeRate(rate);
        } else {
            // Return the old rate if fetching wasn't successful
            rate = exchangeRate;
        }
    }

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/markets/Market.sol#L340

### Recommended Mitigation

```diff

- function updateExchangeRate() public returns (bool updated, uint256 rate) {
+ function updateExchangeRate() public {
+        bool updated;
+        uint256 rate;
        (updated, rate) = oracle.get("");

        if (updated) {
            require(rate > 0, "Market: invalid rate");
            exchangeRate = rate;
            emit LogExchangeRate(rate);
        } else {
            // Return the old rate if fetching wasn't successful
            rate = exchangeRate;
        }
    }

```

##

## [L-11] Avoid shadowing variables. ``ids``variable is shadowed 

### Impact
Variable shadowing can affect the protocol in DeFi in a number of ways, especially when state and function parameters have the same name. For example, if a function parameter has the same name as a state variable, and the function modifies the parameter, then the state variable will also be modified. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as funds being transferred to the wrong address

State variable and parameter names are same 

### POC

```solidity
FILE: YieldBox/contracts/YieldBox.sol

316: function _transferBatch(address from, address to, uint256[] calldata ids, uint256[] calldata values) internal override {

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L316

https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/AssetRegister.sol#L30

### Recommended Mitigation
Choose different name for ``ids`` in ``_transferBatch`` function 

##

## [L-12] NFT ``_tOLPTokenID`` should be generated in a incrementing way

### Impact
Generate NFT token IDs in an incrementing way instead of allowing users to define their own values. This is because user-defined token IDs can be easily manipulated, and they can also be used to create duplicate or invalid tokens.

When ever mint new NFT tokenid should be incremented by one instead of user defined tokenId's

### POC

```solidity
FILE: tap-token-audit/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionBroker.sol

  function participate(
        uint256 _tOLPTokenID
    ) external returns (uint256 oTAPTokenID) {

 // Mint oTAP position
        oTAPTokenID = oTAP.mint(
            msg.sender,
            lock.lockTime + lock.lockDuration,
            uint128(target),
            _tOLPTokenID
        );

```
### Recommended Mitigation
Use state variable generate tokenId. Increment 1 for every new mint 

##

## [L-13] ``TapiocaOptionBroker.sol`` contract inherits ``Pausable`` but not implemented any pause mechanism

### Impact
The ``TapiocaOptionBroker.sol`` contract inherits from the ``Pausable`` contract, but it does not implement any pause mechanism. This means that the contract cannot be paused, and all of the functions in the contract are always available to be called

### POC
```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstap-token-audit/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionBroker.sol

53: contract TapiocaOptionBroker is Pausable, BoringOwnable, TWAML {

````
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionBroker.sol#L53

### Recommended Mitigation
Use pause mechanism or remove safely 

##

## [L-14] ``addCollateral()``addAsset() should be allowed even when contract ``paused`` 

### Impact
The ``addCollateral`` function should be allowed even when the contract is paused. This is because if the liquidation threshold is reached and users positions are liquidated immediately after unpaused, then it is important to allow users to add collateral to prevent their positions from being liquidated.

If the addCollateral function was not allowed when the contract was paused, then users would not be able to add collateral to their positions, and their positions would be liquidated. This would result in users losing their funds, which would be unfair and could damage the reputation of the contract

### POC

```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol

function addCollateral(
        address from,
        address to,
        bool skim,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 share
    ) public allowedBorrow(from, share) notPaused {

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol#L282-L288

https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol#L204-L209

### Recommended Mitigation
Allow addCollateral() even contract ``paused ``

##

## [L-15] Project has NPM Dependency which uses a vulnerable version : @openzeppelin

### Impact
Protocol uses the vulnerable versions of openzeppelin,

Known vulnerabilities 

#### openzeppelin 4.8.2 known vulnerabilities 

 - Improper Input Validation
 - Missing Authorization
 - Denial of Service (DoS)

#### openzeppelin 4.5.0 known vulnerabilities 

 - Missing Authorization
 - Denial of Service (DoS)
 - Improper Input Validation
 - Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
 - Incorrect Calculation
 - Information Exposure

### POC

```solidity

Package.json

- YieldBox -  ``@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.8.2"`` versions

- tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit - ``"@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.5.0"``

- tapioca-periph-audit - `` "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.5.0",``

- tapioca-bar-audit - `` "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.8.2",``

```

### Recommended Mitigation
Use latest ``openzeppelin`` version ``V4.9.3 ``

##

## [L-16] Token transfer to ``address(0)`` should be avoided in ``removeCollateral()`` function

### Impact
Token transfer to ``address(0)`` should be avoided. This is because ``address(0)`` is the "null address", which is a special address that does not belong to any user. If tokens are transferred to address(0), they are effectively lost.

There are a few reasons why token transfer to address(0) should be avoided

 - Tokens transferred to address(0) are effectively lost
 - Token transfer to address(0) can be used to exploit re-entrancy vulnerabilities
 - Token transfer to address(0) can be used to spam the blockchain

### POC

```solidity
FILE: tapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol

function removeCollateral(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 share
    ) public notPaused solvent(from) allowedBorrow(from, share) {
        _removeCollateral(from, to, share);
    }

 function _removeCollateral(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 share
    ) internal {
        userCollateralShare[from] -= share;
        totalCollateralShare -= share;
        emit LogRemoveCollateral(from, to, share);
        yieldBox.transfer(address(this), to, collateralId, share);
    }


```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol#L709-L718

### Recommended Mitigation
Add address(0) check before calling transfer function 

```solidity

require (to != address(0), "null address");

```

##

## [L-17] ``signer`` should be checked with address(0) before ``signer == owner`` check in ``permit()``,``permitAll()`` functions

### Impact
It is always a good practice to be as safe as possible. By checking if the signer is not address(0) before you compare it to the owner of the contract, you can add an extra layer of security to your contract. This will help to prevent even the most sophisticated malicious actors from exploiting your contract

### POC

```solidity
FILE: YieldBox/contracts/YieldBoxPermit.sol

86: address signer = ECDSA.recover(hash, v, r, s);
87: require(signer == owner, "YieldBoxPermit: invalid signature");

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/YieldBoxPermit.sol#L86-L87

### Recommended Mitigation
Add address(0) check

```diff
FILE: YieldBox/contracts/YieldBoxPermit.sol

86: address signer = ECDSA.recover(hash, v, r, s);
+  require(signer != address(0), "Invalid signer ");
87: require(signer == owner, "YieldBoxPermit: invalid signature");

```

##

## [L-18] Recommended to include the ``chain ID`` in the ``_PERMIT_TYPEHASH``,``_PERMIT_ALL_TYPEHASH `` , to prevent malicious actors from ``forging signatures`` on ``other networks``

### Impact
The chain ID is a number that identifies the Ethereum network that the transaction was submitted to. This number is used to prevent malicious actors from forging signatures on other networks.

If you do not include the chain ID in the type hash, then your contract will still be able to verify signatures. However, it will be more vulnerable to signature forgery.

It is recommended to include the chain ID in the type hash, even if it is not strictly necessary. This will help to improve the security of your contract and prevent malicious actors from forging signatures

### POC

```solidity
FILE: YieldBox/contracts/YieldBoxPermit.sol

27: bytes32 private constant _PERMIT_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256("Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 assetId,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)");
    

31: bytes32 private constant _PERMIT_ALL_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256("PermitAll(address owner,address spender,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)");
```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/YieldBoxPermit.sol#L27-L32

### Recommended Mitigation
Include the chain ID in the ``_PERMIT_TYPEHASH``,``_PERMIT_ALL_TYPEHASH `` 

##

## [L-19] ``Constants`` with ``default visibility`` should be avoided. Declare constant with appropriate visibility to avoid unexpected behavior

### Impact
This is because constants with default visibility are visible to contracts in the same scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior. If this is already planned please clearly explain this with contract docs. 

### POC

```solidity
FILE: tap-token-audit/contracts/governance/twTAP.sol

81:    uint256 constant MIN_WEIGHT_FACTOR = 10; // In BPS, 0.1%
82:    uint256 constant dMAX = 100 * 1e4; // 10% - 100% voting power multiplier
83:    uint256 constant dMIN = 10 * 1e4;
95: uint256 constant DIST_PRECISION = 2 ** 128;

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f/contracts/governance/twTAP.sol#L81-L83

### Recommended Mitigation
Constants should be declared with appropriate visibility.

##

## [L-20] Inappropriate Title 

The title suggests its public function but external function implemented 

### POC

```solidity
FILE: tapiocaz-audit/contracts/TapiocaWrapper.sol


// ************************ //
    // *** PUBLIC FUNCTIONS *** //
    // ************************ //

    /// @notice Harvest fees from all the deployed TOFT contracts. Fees are transferred to the owner.
    function harvestFees() external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < harvestableTapiocaOFTs.length; i++) {
            harvestableTapiocaOFTs[i].harvestFees();
        }
        emit HarvestFees(msg.sender);
    }

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapiocaz-audit/blob/bcf61f79464cfdc0484aa272f9f6e28d5de36a8f/contracts/TapiocaWrapper.sol#L92-L102

##

## [L-21] Lack of ``same value`` input ``control`` for setter functions 

### Impact
There is a lack of ``same value`` input ``control`` for setter functions in Solidity. This means that a ``setter function`` can be called with the ``same value`` as the current value of the variable being set. This can lead to ``unexpected behavior``, as the variable will not be changed.

### POC

```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstap-token-audit/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionBroker.sol

function setPaymentTokenBeneficiary(
        address _paymentTokenBeneficiary
    ) external onlyOwner {
        paymentTokenBeneficiary = _paymentTokenBeneficiary;
    }


```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionBroker.sol#L471-L475

### Recommended Mitigation
Add same value input check 

```solidity

require(_paymentTokenBeneficiary !=paymentTokenBeneficiary , " Not possible for same value" );

```
##

## [L-22] Unwanted ``break`` statement

The break statement can be removed from the for loop without affecting the code's functionality. The code will still work the same way, without the break statement

```diff
FILE: Breadcrumbstap-token-audit/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol

for (uint256 i = 0; i < sglLength; i++) {
                // If last element, just pop
                if (i == sglLastIndex) {
                    delete activeSingularities[singularity];
                    delete sglAssetIDToAddress[sglAssetID];
                    singularities.pop();
                } else if (
                    _singularities[i] == sglAssetID && i < sglLastIndex
                ) {
                    // If in the middle, copy last element on deleted element, then pop
                    delete activeSingularities[singularity];
                    delete sglAssetIDToAddress[sglAssetID];

                    singularities[i] = _singularities[sglLastIndex];
                    singularities.pop();
-                     break;
                }

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L323

##

## 

## [L-23] It is possible to ``replay`` the ``_permit`` function if the deadline has not expired

### Impact
This is because the permit function does not store any nonce information. This means that the same permit can be used multiple times, as long as the deadline has not expired. 

### POC

```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/MarketERC20.sol

261: require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "ERC20Permit: expired deadline");

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/markets/MarketERC20.sol#L261

### Recommended Mitigation
To prevent ``replay attacks``, the ``_permit`` function could be modified to store a ``nonce``

##

## [L-24] Donâ€™t use payable(address).call()

### Impact

``payable(address).call()`` is a low-level method that can be used to send ether to a contract, but it has some limitations and risks as you've pointed out. One of the primary risks of using ``payable(address).call()`` is that it doesn't guarantee that the contract's payable function will be called successfully. This can lead to funds being lost or stuck in the contract

The contract does not have a payable callback The contractâ€™s payable callback spends more than 2300 gas (which is only enough to emit something) The contract is called through a proxy which itself uses up the 2300 gas Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s Address.sendValue() instead

### POC

```solidity
FILE: tapiocaz-audit/contracts/TapiocaWrapper.sol

120: (success, result) = payable(_toft).call{value: msg.value}(_bytecode);

141: (success, results[i]) = payable(_call[i].toft).call{
142:                value: msg.value
143:            }(_call[i].bytecode);

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapiocaz-audit/blob/bcf61f79464cfdc0484aa272f9f6e28d5de36a8f/contracts/TapiocaWrapper.sol#L120

### Recommended Mitigation
Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s Address.sendValue()

##

## [L-25] Lack of control for ``withdrawFees()`` . Anyone can call ``withdrawFees()`` send pending fees to ``feeRecipient``

### Impact
The attacker could call the ``withdrawFees`` function ``repeatedly``, which could ``destabilize`` the protocol and make it difficult for users to use the protocol.

### POC

```solidity
FILE: Breadcrumbstapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol

117: function withdrawFees() external {

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/05ba7108a83c66dada98bc5bc75cf18004f2a49b/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L117

### Recommended Mitigation
Implement access control and time based fee emits 

##

## [L-26] Implement reentrancy protection in critical functions like ``addCollateral()``, ``removeCollateral()``,borrow()  ``repay()`` functions

### Impact
Implementing reentrancy protection is crucial to prevent potential attacks where an attacker tries to exploit the contract by repeatedly entering and exiting functions to manipulate state and potentially drain funds. Below, I'll provide a general guideline for adding reentrancy protection to critical functions like ``addCollateral()``, ``removeCollateral()``, ``borrow()``, and ``repay()`` using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern and the ``nonReentrant`` modifier


```solidity
FILE: tapioca-bar-audit/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol

263: function repay(
        address from,
        address to,
        bool,
        uint256 part
    ) public notPaused allowedBorrow(from, part) returns (uint256 amount) {

242: function borrow(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) public notPaused solvent(from) returns (uint256 part, uint256 share) {

282: function addCollateral(
        address from,
        address to,
        bool skim,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 share
    ) public allowedBorrow(from, share) notPaused {

296: function removeCollateral(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 share
    ) public notPaused solvent(from) allowedBorrow(from, share) {

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol#L282-L288

### Recommended Mitigation
add ``nonReentrant`` modifier for critical functions 

##

## [L-27] ``address(this).balance >= amount`` contract's balance might change between the ``time`` the ``require`` statement is executed

### Impact
The ``address(this).balance >= amount`` statement might not be accurate because the contract's balance might change between the ``time`` the require statement is executed and the time the ``create2`` assembly is executed. This is because ``other transactions`` might be executed in the ``meantime``

### POC

```solidity
FILE: tapioca-periph-audit/contracts/TapiocaDeployer/TapiocaDeployer.sol

29: require(
            address(this).balance >= amount,
            "Create2: insufficient balance"
        );

```
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/023751a4e987cf7c203ab25d3abba58f7344f213/contracts/TapiocaDeployer/TapiocaDeployer.sol#L28-L31

### Recommended Mitigation
Use a nonce .The nonce can be used to ensure that the require statement only checks the balance of the contract at the time the transaction is executed

##

## [L-28] ``create2`` assembly may not be executed correctly if the ``salt`` is not unique

### Impact
The ``create2`` assembly may not be executed correctly if the salt is not unique. This is because the create2 assembly uses the salt to prevent collisions. If the salt is not unique, then it is possible that two different contracts will be created with the same address.

### POC
```solidity
FILE: tapioca-periph-audit/contracts/TapiocaDeployer/TapiocaDeployer.sol

41: addr := create2(amount, add(bytecode, 0x20), mload(bytecode), salt) 

```

## Recommended Mitigation
it is important to use a ``unique salt`` for each ``create2 call``. The salt can be any ``arbitrary value``, but it is important to make sure that it is ``unique``

##

## [L-29] ``salt`` and ``bytecodeHash`` values should be unique for every call in computeAddress() function

### Impact
If the ``bytecodeHash`` and ``salt`` values are not unique, then the function will produce the same address for ``multiple contracts``.

### POC
```solidity
FILE: tapioca-periph-audit/contracts/TapiocaDeployer/TapiocaDeployer.sol

 function computeAddress(
        bytes32 salt,
        bytes32 bytecodeHash,

            mstore(add(ptr, 0x40), bytecodeHash)
            mstore(add(ptr, 0x20), salt)
            mstore(ptr, deployer) // Right-aligned with 12 preceding garbage bytes
            let start := add(ptr, 0x0b) // The hashed data starts at the final garbage byte which we will set to 0xff
            mstore8(start, 0xff)
            addr := keccak256(start, 85)
        }

### Recommended Mitigation
Ensure both ``bytecodeHash``,``salt`` unique for every call
