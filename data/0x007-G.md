## isSolvent is executed twice inside for loop of market.liquidate
`_isSolvent(user, _exchangeRate)` is checked in `_liquidateUser`. `_liquidateUser` is called in `_closedLiquidation` only. But `_closedLiquidation` checks for `_isSolvent(user, _exchangeRate)` as well before calling `_liquidateUser`. This is an unnecessary waste of gas. `_isSolvent(user, _exchangeRate)` should be checked once, either in `_liquidateUser` or `_closedLiquidation`. `_isSolvent` performs 8 `SLOAD` and calls `yieldBox.toAmount`, and this issue affects but BigBang and Singularity liquidate function.

## _requireTransferAllowed is executed twice inside for loop of yieldbox.batchTransfer
`_transferBatch` calls `_requireTransferAllowed(from, isApprovedForAsset[from][msg.sender][id])` inside for loop before updating balance of users. However `batchTransfer`--which is the only function that calls `_transferBatch`--performs the same check. This is unnecessary and just use up gas.

## No need for BigBang.totalFees
totalFees is a state in BigBang and it is used in refreshPenroseFees function only. refreshPenroseFees would increment totalFees by balance, then reset it to 0. That's 2 SSTORE and the result is that totalFees would always be 0. There's no need for this state cause refreshPenroseFees would work fine if it uses a memory instead for totalFees. totalFees takes up storage slot and wastes gas.
