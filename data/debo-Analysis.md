Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings:
I found unfiltered dangerous functions.

Approach taken in evaluating the codebase:
1. Use Mythx to search for bugs.
2. Once medium or high bug found then write a POC for it.
3. Then submit.

Architecture recommendations:
Utilize AI more.

Codebase quality analysis:
Use apostrophes instead of quotes.
There are a lot of floating pragmas.
Some requirements violations.
A lot of overflow and underflow which I assume are false positives.

Centralization risks:
When loaning avoid monopoly by capping individual limits as a percentage, but over time the limit can increase as subscriber base increases.

Mechanism review:
Most of the code files seem secure enough.  
But mostly, the issues are not a concern, such as floating pragmas and requirements violations.
Some folders are not downloaded easily from github or are not in github.

Systemic risks:
I do not see a risk of an overall structure breakdown. 
Unfiltered dangerous functions like transfer ownership.
