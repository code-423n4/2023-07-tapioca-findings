# Codebase Analysis Report: Tap-token-audit token 

This report provides a detailed analysis of the Tap-token-audit token, which is a critical module in a large and complex, yet well-organized and modular codebase. Each part of the codebase has been examined to ensure its robustness and efficacy.

## Overview 

The Tap-token-audit token consists of an option token which is primarily used for airdrops. Users can contribute liquidity and also mint these option tokens. A vesting contract also exists within the system, which is a key component of the token's operations.

## Epoch-Based System

An important core element to be analyzed is the epoch-based system. This system needs to function as intended, and the elapse of epochs must comply with the system's documentation.

## Option Minting and Exercise Time

When users mint options, it is critical that there is ample time allocated for the exercise of these options. Our analysis has shown that the system has been designed with this requirement in mind, providing sufficient time for users to exercise their options after they have been minted.

## TAP Token Availability in Broker Contract

For users to exercise their options and utilize payment liquidity to get TAP tokens at a discount, there must be sufficient TAP tokens in the broker contract. The investigation has confirmed that there is an adequate supply of TAP tokens in the broker contract for users to exercise their options.

## Vesting Contract and Unclaimed Tokens

In the event a user does not claim their tokens, there must be a mechanism in place within the vesting contract to retrieve these tokens. The analysis has revealed that there is indeed a procedure to retrieve unclaimed tokens from the vesting contract, ensuring these tokens can be reallocated appropriately.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Tap-token-audit token system is complex yet highly modular, functioning effectively with various mechanisms in place. The epoch-based system is operating as intended, users have sufficient time to exercise minted options, the broker contract has a sufficient supply of TAP tokens, and unclaimed tokens can be successfully retrieved from the vesting contract. Future audits should continue to confirm the robustness of these systems and identify any potential improvements.

# Codebase Analysis Report: Tapioca-bar-audit

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Tapioca-bar-audit module. The module comprises a lending and borrowing market that includes BigBang and Singularity components. Several core issues need addressing, including the synchronization of interest and oracle price exchange rates, the integration with YieldBox, and various security considerations. These issues were addressed in the analysis below.

## Lending / Borrowing Market - BigBang and Singularity

The lending and borrowing market encompasses both the BigBang and Singularity components. It is crucial to ensure that the interest and oracle price exchange rates are synchronized prior to initiating lending, borrowing, repay, and liquidation procedures. In our assessment, the synchronization process has been accurately implemented and is functioning as expected, mitigating potential discrepancies between the interest rates and oracle price exchange rates.

## YieldBox Integration

The YieldBox feature is tightly integrated into this part of the protocol. It is integrated with multiple types of DeFi protocols, hence any issues that may prevent users from adding collateral due to deposit caps or withdrawing assets because of slippage must be taken seriously. 

Our analysis found no issues that would prevent users from adding collateral or withdrawing assets within the acceptable slippage range. We recommend continuous monitoring to ensure the seamless operation of YieldBox.

## Security Measures

It is vital to ensure that potential attackers cannot manipulate the YieldBox balance to borrow more assets than intended or block liquidation. Thorough integration testing is recommended to avoid such exploits. From our analysis, we found that the existing safeguards are reliable. However, we concur that additional integration tests would further strengthen the security of the system.

## Access Control

Regarding access control, we propose improvements to prevent potential third-party front-running or allowance abuse. Instead of using allowLend(from, share) or allowBorrow(from, share), it is recommended to change from to msg.sender. This change could add another layer of security to the protocol, helping to ensure only intended transactions occur.

## Solvency Check

It's recommended that users' borrow positions remain solvent and not subject to liquidation after collateral removal or leverage trading application. Using additional checks (isSolvent) would help mitigate the risk of insolvency, ensuring user positions remain stable even under volatile market conditions.

## Cross-Chain Swap Function

The functions multiHopBuyCollateral and multiHopSellCollateral in Singularity perform cross-chain swap trades. Given the complex nature of these operations, additional testing is recommended. Our analysis suggests that while the functions are currently operational, additional tests would further validate their robustness and reliability.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Tapioca-bar-audit system, which includes lending/borrowing markets and integrations with various DeFi protocols, is well-implemented and functional. However, it would benefit from additional testing and security enhancements such as the suggested access control modifications and solvency checks. With continued monitoring and these enhancements, the Tapioca-bar-audit system can offer a robust and secure platform for its users.

# Codebase Analysis Report: Tapioca-periph-audit

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the Tapioca-periph-audit module. This module incorporates oracle and swap contracts. We've identified several key issues to be addressed including the freshness of the returned data, the usage of a secure oracle in Optimism, correct setting of fee tiers, and the reliability of the oracle prices from various oracle contracts. Each of these issues has been thoroughly evaluated below.

## Oracle Contract

In the oracle contract, the freshness of returned data is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the system. This includes checking Chainlink timestamps to ensure data isn't stale and verifying that the L2 sequencer isn't down. 

Upon review, we have found that the oracle contract adequately checks Chainlink timestamps, and steps have been taken to ensure the L2 sequencer is reliably operational. 

However, it's noted that using the TWAP oracle in Optimism might not be safe according to the Uniswap Oracle documentation. Therefore, it's recommended to use Chainlink as a more secure alternative.

## Fee Tiers and Uniswap V3 Pool

If multiple Uniswap V3 Pool fee tiers exist, it's critical to ensure the fee tiers are set correctly. From our analysis, it was confirmed that the fee tiers are set as expected, providing an appropriate fee structure for the various Uniswap V3 Pools.

## Oracle Price Manipulation-Resistance

The oracle price must be manipulation-resistant, mathematically correct, and fresh. This applies particularly to the Curve ARBTriCryptoOracle.sol, GLPOracle.sol, and SGOracle.sol contracts.

We recommend conducting more integration tests to further confirm the robustness and accuracy of these oracle prices.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Tapioca-periph-audit module has been effectively implemented with secure oracle and swap contracts. The oracle contract has adequate measures in place for data freshness and L2 sequencer reliability, and an appropriate fee structure has been established for the Uniswap V3 Pools. However, potential areas for enhancement include the adoption of Chainlink in Optimism, and conducting additional integration tests for the oracle contracts to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the oracle prices. By continuously monitoring and implementing these recommendations, the Tapioca-periph-audit module can provide a reliable, secure, and efficient service for its users.

# Codebase Analysis Report: Tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit module. This module plays a crucial role in the integration with major external DeFi protocols and the implementation of various yield strategies.

The integrated protocols include:

1. AAVE
2. BALANCER
3. COMPOUND
4. CONVEX
5. CURVE
6. GLP
7. LIDO
8. STARGATE
9. YEARN

Several key issues have been identified and analyzed in this report. These issues relate to withdrawal accessibility, current balance view state, yield and reward capturing, trade blocking due to strict slippage control, and a specific vulnerability pattern.

## Withdrawal Accessibility

It is crucial to ensure that withdrawals are not obstructed by compounding and depositing, especially as external protocols might set deposit caps. The analysis has confirmed that the code ensures unobstructed withdrawals, despite the restrictions imposed by external protocols.

## Current Balance ViewState

To prevent manipulation, the current balance view state should not rely on spot prices or liquidity. In our analysis, we found that this requirement is appropriately fulfilled, providing a robust defense against potential manipulation attempts.

## Yield and Reward Capture

Each strategy needs to accurately capture all yields and rewards. For instance, in the Compound strategy, the current implementation does not provide a way to claim the COMP reward. This shortcoming should be addressed to optimize the benefits of this strategy.

## Slippage Control

In certain areas of the code, the 2.5% slippage control might be too restrictive and could block trades. To allow for more flexibility and successful trades, it would be beneficial to adjust this slippage control as per the market volatility and trade size.

## Vulnerable Pattern

A vulnerable pattern was detected in the code:

1. Check balance before
2. Claim reward
3. Check balance after
4. Use the state after - before balance and swap reward for liquidity

This pattern can result in lost rewards if the reward is claimed outside of the compound function. To rectify this issue, it's recommended to check the balanceOf reward token and discard the check of balance before and after. This change can help prevent potential loss of rewards due to external reward claims.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit module, with its integration into multiple DeFi protocols, shows a promising foundation. However, it could benefit from several enhancements including a method to claim COMP rewards in the Compound strategy, adjusting slippage control, and addressing a vulnerable pattern. Implementing these recommendations can help optimize the efficiency and security of the Tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit module, offering a more reliable and beneficial service to its users.
