## Advanced Analysis Report for [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) by K42

### Overview 

- [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) is a decentralized autonomous organization that has developed a suite of smart contracts for various DeFi applications, including a lending and borrowing platform [Singularity](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol), a yield farming platform [YieldBox](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol), a token [Tap](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f), and a variety of strategies for yield optimization, as well as stablecoin minting.

- The primary product of the DAO is the [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol), or the Omnidollar, a decentralized, over-collateralized & non-algorithmic, censorship-resistant omnichain stablecoin that is programmatically aligned to the U.S. Dollar. The [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) is unique in that it utilizes gas tokens and liquid staking derivatives as its sole backing, and employs a novel incentive structure, [twAML](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/twAML.sol), based on capturing protocol owned liquidity. The ecosystem also includes a range of other contracts and modules that provide additional functionality and services.

### Understanding the Ecosystem:
The [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) ecosystem is composed of several interconnected components:

- [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol): The core stablecoin of the ecosystem, backed by gas tokens and liquid staking derivatives. It is natively composable, utilizing gas tokens & liquid staking derivatives as its sole backing, and employs a novel incentive structure, [twAML](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/twAML.sol), based on capturing protocol owned liquidity.

- [Singularity](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol): A lending and borrowing platform that allows users to leverage their assets. It includes modules for collateral, borrowing, leverage, and liquidation.

- [YieldBox](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol): A yield farming platform that allows users to earn returns on their assets. It includes a variety of strategies for yield optimization. It's still under development and contributions are encouraged.

- [Tap Token](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f): The native token of the ecosystem, which is used for governance and rewards distribution. ERC20 and ERC721 implementations, as well as options and vesting contracts. 

- [Strategies](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/tree/05ba7108a83c66dada98bc5bc75cf18004f2a49b): A variety of yield optimization strategies are implemented, including strategies for [Yearn](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/yearn/YearnStrategy.sol), [Compound](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/compound/CompoundStrategy.sol), [Lido](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/lido/LidoEthStrategy.sol), [Curve](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/tree/master/contracts/Swapper/CurveSwapper.sol), [Stargate](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/stargate/StargateStrategy.sol), [Aave](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/aave/AaveStrategy.sol), [Balancer](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/balancer/BalancerStrategy.sol), [GLP](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol), and [Convex](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/tree/master/contracts/convex/ConvexTricryptoStrategy.sol).

### Codebase Quality Analysis: 
- The codebase for [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) is extensive and complex, with a total of ``62`` contracts in scope for this analysis. These contracts are spread across several repositories, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the ecosystem. The code is generally well-structured and organized, with clear separation of concerns and modular design. This makes it easier to understand the functionality of each contract and how they interact with each other.

- The contracts are well-documented, with clear descriptions of their functions and interactions. The use of libraries and abstract contracts helps to reduce code duplication and increase modularity, including [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) and [BoringCrypto](https://github.com/boringcrypto/BoringSolidity), which are well-regarded in the Ethereum community for their security and reliability. This suggests that the developers have taken care to use secure and tested code where possible. However, the complexity of the ecosystem and the interdependencies among contracts could potentially lead to unforeseen interactions and vulnerabilities. The use of advanced Solidity features and low-level calls also increases the risk of bugs and exploits. 

- The code also includes a range of gas optimizations, which were identified and implemented as part of a previous audit. For this audit, I primarily focused on identifying as many efficient gas optimizations as possible. These optimizations can further help to reduce the cost of transactions within the ecosystem, therefore the usability, and scalability, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

### Architecture Recommendations: 
- The architecture of the [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) is robust and scalable. However, it is recommended to implement a proxy contract pattern for upgradability. This will allow the DAO to upgrade the contracts without affecting the users' funds or disrupting the services.

- It is also recommended that thorough and up-to-date documentation be maintained for all contracts and modules within the ecosystem. This would help to ensure that the functionality and intended use of each contract is clear, and would assist in identifying and resolving any potential issues.

### Centralization Risks: 
- The [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) is a decentralized organization, which mitigates the risks of centralization. However, the governance of the DAO is controlled by the holders of the [Tap Token](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f). This could potentially lead to centralization if a small group of holders accumulates a large amount of [Tap Tokens](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f).

- The [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) ecosystem includes several contracts and modules that are owned or controlled by a single entity, such as the [Penrose](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/Penrose.sol) contract for [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) and [BB](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol), and the [TapiocaDeployer](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/tree/master/contracts/TapiocaDeployer/TapiocaDeployer.sol) contract. This centralization of control could potentially lead to censorship, manipulation, or other forms of abuse.

### Mechanism Review: 
- The mechanism of the [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) is designed to provide a variety of DeFi services. The staking mechanism in the [Tapioca Bar](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/tree/master/contracts) contract allows users to earn rewards by staking their tokens. The [YieldBox](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol) contract provides a yield farming mechanism where users can earn rewards by providing liquidity.
- The governance mechanism is controlled by the [Tap Token](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f). The holders of the [Tap Token](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f) can vote on proposals and make decisions about the direction of the DAO.
- The staking mechanism in [Tapioca Bar](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/tree/master/contracts) and the reward distribution mechanism in [Tap Token](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f) are well-implemented and secure.
- The [YieldBox](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol) project is still under development, but the proposed features and mechanisms are promising.
- The [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) stablecoin mechanism, which uses gas tokens and liquid staking derivatives as backing, and employs a novel incentive structure, [twAML](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/twAML.sol), is particularly noteworthy. However, the stability and scalability of this mechanism in the face of market volatility and adversarial behaviour remains to be seen.
- The [Singularity](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol) lending and borrowing platform, the [YieldBox](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol) yield farming platform, and the [Tap Token](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f) also include a variety of mechanisms for collateralization, borrowing, leverage, liquidation, yield optimization, options, and vesting. These mechanisms are well-designed and implemented, but their interactions and potential vulnerabilities need to be carefully analyzed and tested.

- The mechanisms used within the [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) ecosystem are complex and innovative. The use of gas tokens and liquid staking derivatives as the sole backing for the [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) stablecoin is a novel approach that could potentially offer significant benefits in terms of stability and scalability. However, this mechanism also introduces additional complexity and potential risks, and should be thoroughly reviewed and tested.
- The [twAML](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/twAML.sol) incentive structure is another innovative mechanism that aims to capture protocol owned liquidity. This could potentially provide significant benefits in terms of incentivizing user participation and increasing the liquidity of the ecosystem. However, as with the [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) backing mechanism, this introduces additional complexity and potential risks, and should be thoroughly reviewed and tested.

### Systemic Risks: 
- The [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) ecosystem is exposed to a variety of systemic risks, including smart contract bugs and exploits, economic attacks, oracle failures, and regulatory risks.

- The complexity and interdependencies of the contracts increase the risk of bugs and exploits, as do the use of advanced Solidity features and low-level calls. The reliance on external oracles for price feeds also exposes the ecosystem to oracle failures or manipulations.

- The economic mechanisms of the ecosystem, including the [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) stablecoin and the [Singularity](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol) and [YieldBox](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol) platforms, could potentially be exploited by adversarial actors through flash loans, arbitrage, or other forms of economic attacks.

- The regulatory status of the ecosystem, particularly the [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) stablecoin and the [Tap Token](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f), could also pose risks, depending on the jurisdiction and the interpretation of the law.

## Areas of Concern
- Complexity and Interdependencies: The complexity of the ecosystem and the interdependencies among contracts could potentially lead to unforeseen interactions and vulnerabilities.

- Advanced Solidity Features and Low-Level Calls: The use of advanced Solidity features and low-level calls increases the risk of bugs and exploits.

- Centralization of Control: The centralization of control in certain contracts could potentially lead to censorship, manipulation, or other forms of abuse.

- Oracle Dependence: The reliance on external oracles for price feeds exposes the ecosystem to oracle failures or manipulations.

- Economic Attacks: The economic mechanisms of the ecosystem could potentially be exploited by adversarial actors through flash loans, arbitrage, or other forms of economic attacks.

- Regulatory Risks: The regulatory status of the ecosystem, particularly the [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) stablecoin and the [Tap Token](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f), could pose risks, depending on the jurisdiction and the interpretation of the law.

- The main area of concern is the potential for centralization in the governance mechanism. It is important for the DAO to ensure a fair distribution of the [Tap Tokens](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/tree/59749be5bc2286f0bdbf59d7ddc258ddafd49a9f) to prevent a small group of holders from controlling the governance.

- The [YieldBox](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol) project is still under development and may face challenges in implementation and adoption.
- The [USDO](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/2286f80f928f41c8bc189d0657d74ba83286c668/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) stablecoin's reliance on gas tokens and liquid staking derivatives as its sole backing could pose risks if the value of these assets fluctuates significantly.

### Codebase Analysis
The codebase of the [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) is well-written and follows the best practices of solidity development. The contracts are modular and reusable, which makes the codebase easy to maintain and extend.

- The codebase is well-structured and follows good development practices. It is modular, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- The contracts are written in Solidity and follow the latest standards.
