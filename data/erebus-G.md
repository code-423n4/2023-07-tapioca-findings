Double check to ensure the transfer of tokens is allowed. The lines [YieldBox.sol#L310](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L310) and [YieldBox.sol#L322](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L322) do exactly the same, thus it cost gas unnecessarily. Remove the one in line 322 (the second one)

Consider adding an `else` clause instead of the [return here](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/023751a4e987cf7c203ab25d3abba58f7344f213/contracts/Magnetar/modules/MagnetarMarketModule.sol#L698) so that it saves bytecode size by removing one return opcode, that is `if(!dest chain) {...} else {...}` instead of the current implementation (which has two implicit `return` routines, one at the end of the `if` and the other at the end of the function).
