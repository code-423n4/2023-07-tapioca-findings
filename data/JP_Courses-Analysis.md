Approach to evaluate the codebase as a solo auditor?
Cry.

Besides crying :P I tried to focus on going over the in scope contracts several times while attempting to understand the codebase better each time. I got distracted by potential findings every time.

During July this is not the only contest I focused on, so I did not have as much time as I hoped, for this contest. I hope that some of my findings are valid, as I really tried my best to hunt down bugs and confirm that they are indeed valid. If any of my findings are invalid, please forgive me noobness, I'm getting there, I'm getting better.

Made sure I read the docs enough to have a good understanding of the different parts. The entire experience helped improve my understanding of LayerZero protocol too, which I'm actually busy tackling on ImmuneFi as a bug bounty. So it all helps, and would have helped me with TapiocaDAO if I gave myself more time, or if the contest was longer LOL.

I learned that TapiocaDAO is a pretty solid codebase already, which is impressive and unexpected for such a massive codebase with such small team of devs, presumably. They did an admirable job to take on such a formidable challenge.

It's such a cool protocol that I would be happy if they eventually launched a bug bounty so that I could have a great excuse to dive into their codebase again, this time deeper and for longer, with context I gained from this contest! :)

Contextualize my findings:

Besides what I already mentioned, I need to definitely start working on my PoC skills, this is one of my primary weaknesses, so I'll start focusing on improving that. I tried my best to describe the vulnerabilities, and here and there write simple PoCs.

Thanks
