## Q/A Report For [Tapioca-DAO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-tapioca) 

### Possible Q/A Optimizations:
I focused on some of the main contracts for efficiency: 

### No-1:
In [TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L61C1-L61C67), 
the [singularities](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L63C2-L63C77) array is used in the contract in several places, listed below:

- In the [getSingularities()](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L121C1-L123C6) function, which returns the array.
- In the [getSingularityPools()](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L126C1-L143C6) function, where it's used to iterate over the active singularities.
- In the [registerSingularity()](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L276C1-L293C6) function, where a new singularity is added to the array.
- In the [unregisterSingularity()](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L297C1-L329C6) function, where a singularity is removed from the array.

The optimization would involve removing the singularities array and the getSingularities() function, and modifying the [getSingularityPools()](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L126C1-L143C6), [registerSingularity()](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L276C1-L293C6), and [unregisterSingularity()](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-token-audit/blob/main/contracts/options/TapiocaOptionLiquidityProvision.sol#L297C1-L329C6) functions to work without the singularities array. This optimization could save around 20,000 gas for each addition or removal of a ``singularity`` asset ID, therefore optimizing quality of usage.



After Optimization:




```solidity
// Remove the singularities array
// uint256[] public singularities; // Array of active singularity asset IDs

// Remove the getSingularities function
// function getSingularities() external view returns (uint256[] memory) {
//     return singularities;
// }

// Modify the getSingularityPools function to iterate over the activeSingularities mapping instead of the singularities array
function getSingularityPools() external view returns (SingularityPool[] memory) {
    SingularityPool[] memory pools = new SingularityPool[](activeSingularities.length);
    uint256 i = 0;
    for (IERC20 singularity in activeSingularities) {
        pools[i] = activeSingularities[singularity];
        i++;
    }
    return pools;
}

// Modify the registerSingularity function to not add the new singularity to the singularities array
function registerSingularity(IERC20 singularity, uint256 assetID, uint256 weight) external onlyOwner updateTotalSGLPoolWeights {
    require(assetID > 0, "tOLP: invalid asset ID");
    require(activeSingularities[singularity].sglAssetID == 0, "tOLP: already registered");
    activeSingularities[singularity].sglAssetID = assetID;
    activeSingularities[singularity].poolWeight = weight > 0 ? weight : 1;
    sglAssetIDToAddress[assetID] = singularity;
    // singularities.push(assetID);
    emit RegisterSingularity(address(singularity), assetID);
}

// Modify the unregisterSingularity function to not remove the singularity from the singularities array
function unregisterSingularity(IERC20 singularity) external onlyOwner updateTotalSGLPoolWeights {
    uint256 sglAssetID = activeSingularities[singularity].sglAssetID;
    require(sglAssetID > 0, "tOLP: not registered");
    delete activeSingularities[singularity];
    delete sglAssetIDToAddress[sglAssetID];
    // singularities.pop();
    emit UnregisterSingularity(address(singularity), sglAssetID);
}
```




Please note that the for (IERC20 singularity in activeSingularities) syntax is pseudocode. Solidity does not support iterating over keys in a mapping directly. You would need to keep track of the keys in a separate data structure or use a different approach. This is one of the trade-offs of this optimization: while it can save gas, it can also make the code more complex and harder to manage, for this reason I added it as a Q/A, instead of a gas optimization.  

## No-2:  
The [USDO.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/usd0/USDO.sol) contract appears to be well-structured and follows good practices in Solidity programming. However, there are a few general areas where the quality and longevity of the contract could be improved:

Input Validation: 
- The contract does a good job of validating inputs in most cases, but there are a few places where additional checks could be beneficial. For example, in the mint and burn functions, it might be a good idea to add a check to ensure that the _amount is greater than zero. This can prevent unnecessary transactions and potential errors.

Clearer Error Messages: 
- The contract uses error messages to provide context when a require statement fails. This is a good practice, but the messages could be more descriptive. For example, "USDO: token not valid" could be changed to "USDO: Only USDO token is valid for this operation". This can make it easier for developers and users to understand what went wrong when a transaction fails.
Access Control: 
- The contract uses a simple access control mechanism to restrict who can call the mint and burn functions. This is a good start, but it might be beneficial to use a more robust access control mechanism, such as OpenZeppelin's ``AccessControl`` contract. This can provide more flexibility and security.

Upgradeability: 
- The contract does not appear to be upgradeable. While this can be a design choice for security reasons, it can limit the contract's longevity if changes need to be made in the future. Consider using an upgradeable contract pattern, such as OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts.

## No-3 
The [MagnetarV2.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol) contract appears to be a complex contract that interacts with a variety of other contracts and modules to provide functionality related to a DeFi platform. Here's a high-level quality assurance analysis:

General Structure:
- The contract inherits from [Ownable](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L30C24-L30C50) and [MagnetarV2Storage](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L30C24-L30C50), which suggests that it has an owner who can perform privileged operations and uses a separate contract for storage to keep state variables.

Libraries: 
- The contract uses the ``SafeERC20`` library for safe interactions with ``ERC20`` tokens and ``RebaseLibrary`` for operations related to rebasing.

Enumerations:
- The contract defines an ``enumeration`` Module with a single value [Market](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L37C4-L39C6). This suggests that the contract might be designed to work with different modules, but currently only supports a ``market`` module.

State Variables:
- The contract has a state variable [marketModule](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L41C1-L42C46) of type [MagnetarMarketModule](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L41C1-L42C46), which suggests that it interacts with a ``market`` module for some of its functionality.

Constructor:
- The [constructor](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L44C2-L47C6) takes an ``owner`` and a ``market`` module as parameters, suggesting that these can be set at deployment time.

Functions:
- The contract has a variety of functions, many of which are public or external and view, suggesting that they are used to retrieve information about the state of the contract or the system it interacts with. Some of these functions include [singularityMarketInfo](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L55C4-L60C6), [bigBangMarketInfo](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L65C3-L70C6), [getCollateralAmountForShare](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L76C1-L82C6), [getCollateralSharesForBorrowPart](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L89C1-L111C6), [getAmountForBorrowPart](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L117C2-L127C6), [getBorrowPartForAmount](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L133C1-L143C6), [getAmountForAssetFraction](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L150C1-L164C6), [getFractionForAmount](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L171C1-L187C6), and more.

- The contract also has a [burst](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L194) function which appears to be a key function that performs a variety of actions based on the input parameters. This function seems to be designed to handle a batch of operations in a single transaction, which can be efficient in terms of gas usage.

Modifiers: 
- The contract does not seem to use any custom modifiers.

Events:
- The contract does not seem to emit any custom events.

Error Handling:
- The contract uses require statements for error checking and validation, which is a good practice. However, it also uses revert statements with hard-coded error messages, which could be replaced with custom error codes for better error handling.

Security Considerations: 
- The contract uses ``delegatecall`` in the [_executeModule](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-periph-audit/blob/main/contracts/Magnetar/MagnetarV2.sol#L1064C1-L1075C6) function, which can be risky if not handled properly as it allows another contract to execute code in the context of the calling contract.

Overall Code Quality: 
- The contract appears to be well-structured and uses clear and descriptive names for functions and variables. It also uses libraries for safe operations and complex calculations. However, the contract is quite complex and interacts with many other contracts, which can make it harder to reason about its behaviour and potential security risks.

## No-4

For the [Singularity.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol) contract: 

Code Comments: 
- While the contract has some comments, it could benefit from more detailed explanations of what each function does, what the parameters are, and what the expected output is. This can help other developers understand the contract more easily and reduce the likelihood of errors when interacting with it.

Error Messages: 
- The contract uses error messages in several places, which is good practice. However, these messages could be more descriptive. For example, instead of "SGL: not valid", you could specify what exactly is not valid.

Function Visibility: 
- It's important to ensure that functions have the correct visibility to prevent unauthorized access. For example, the [addAsset](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol#L204C1-L212C6), [removeAsset](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol#L219C1-L227C6), [addCollateral](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol#L235C1-L253C6), [removeCollateral](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol#L259C1-L269C6), [borrow](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol#L277C1-L287C6), [repay](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol#L296C1-L313C6), and other similar functions are all ``public``. If these functions are not meant to be called by anyone, consider changing their visibility to ``internal`` or ``private``.

Security: 
- The contract uses ``delegatecall`` in the [_executeModule](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/singularity/Singularity.sol#L618C1-L630C1) function, which can be risky if not handled properly. Make sure that the contract addresses that will be called are trusted and cannot be manipulated by an attacker.

## No-5 

For the [Penrose.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/Penrose.sol) contract, which has modules and functionalities. Here are some areas of improvement and quality assurance:

Modular Design: 
- The contract is well-structured and modular, which is a good practice. However, it could be further improved by separating the logic into more contracts or libraries. This would make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

Error Messages: 
- The contract uses revert messages to indicate the reason for transaction failures. This is a good practice as it helps with debugging and provides more information to the users of the contract. However, some of the error messages like "Penrose: MC not registered" could be more descriptive to provide clearer information about the error.

Access Control: 
- The contract uses the ``Ownable`` pattern for access control, which is a good practice. However, it could benefit from a more granular access control system, such as using roles for different functionalities.

Code Comments: 
- The contract has some comments, but they could be more comprehensive. Adding more comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each function and variable would make the contract easier to understand and maintain.

Use of unchecked{}: 
- The contract uses the unchecked{} block to prevent overflow/underflow checks. While this can save gas, it should be used cautiously as it can lead to unexpected behaviour if not handled correctly.

Event Logging:
- The contract emits events for significant state changes, which is a good practice. However, it could benefit from more detailed event logs, such as including the caller's address or the old and new values when a state variable is updated.

Function Complexity:
- Some functions like [executeMarketFn](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/Penrose.sol#L424C5-L451C1) and [_withdrawAllProtocolFees](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/Penrose.sol#L485C1-L497C6) are quite complex and could be broken down into smaller, more manageable functions.

## No-6 

For the [BigBang.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol) contract: 

Coding Style and Readability: 
- The contract appears to be well-structured and follows the Solidity style guide, which makes it easier to read and understand. The use of comments is minimal, and it would be beneficial to include more descriptive comments explaining the purpose and functionality of functions and complex logic.

Use of Inheritance: 
- The contract [BigBang.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol) inherits from [BoringOwnable](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol#L39C21-L39C42) and [Market](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol#L39C21-L39C42), which is a common practice in Solidity to achieve code reusability and separation of concerns. However, without the code for these inherited contracts, it's hard to assess the full functionality of [BigBang.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-bar-audit/blob/master/contracts/markets/bigBang/BigBang.sol).

State Variables: 
- The contract uses a variety of state variables, including mappings, structs, and simple data types. The purpose of most of these variables is clear from their names and usage. However, comments explaining their purpose would be beneficial.

Functions:
- The contract includes a variety of functions for managing collateral, borrowing, repaying, liquidating, and more. Some functions are marked as internal, meaning they can only be called from within this contract or contracts that inherit from it. Others are public and can be called from anywhere. The use of function modifiers like ``notPaused``, ``solvent``, and ``allowedBorrow`` is a good practice for enforcing conditions for function execution.

Events: 
- The contract emits events for significant actions, which is a good practice for enabling off-chain services to track the contract's activity.

Security: 
- The contract uses ``SafeMath`` for arithmetic operations, which is a good practice to prevent integer overflow and underflow attacks. It also uses the ``onlyOwner`` modifier for functions that should have restricted access. 

Error Handling:
- The contract uses require statements to enforce conditions and validate inputs, which is a good practice for error handling in Solidity.

Upgradability: 
- The contract does not appear to be upgradable. If the contract needs to be changed, a new contract would need to be deployed.

External Calls: 
- The contract makes external calls to other contracts, such as ``penrose``, ``yieldBox``, and ``swapper``. These calls can potentially introduce security risks, especially if the called contracts are not trusted or have not been audited.

## No-7 

The [GlpStrategy.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol) contract is designed to interact with a number of other contracts and tokens in the ecosystem, including ``GMX``, ``esGMX``, and ``WETH``. The contract is designed to handle staking, vesting, and rewards distribution. Here are some key points:

Contract Inheritance: 
- The contract inherits from [BaseERC20Strategy](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L23C25-L23C57) and [BoringOwnable](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L23C25-L23C57). The former likely provides the basic functionality for interacting with ERC20 tokens, while the latter provides ownership functionality.

Immutable Variables: 
- The contract has several immutable variables that are set in the constructor and cannot be changed afterwards. These include references to other contracts and tokens in the ecosystem, such as the ``GMX`` token, ``esGMX`` token, ``WETH`` token, and various other contracts for managing rewards, vesting, and staking.

Constructor: 
- The [constructor](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L53C5-L84C1) sets up the contract with references to the necessary contracts and tokens. It also checks that the ``WETH`` address matches the ``WETH`` address from the ``GMX`` reward router, and that the ``GMX`` reward router and ``GLP`` reward router are correctly configured.

Harvesting: 
- The [harvest](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L96C2-L102C6) and [harvestGmx](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L104C1-L111C6) functions are used to claim rewards, buy ``GLP``, vest by ``GLP``, stake ``esGMX``, and vest by ``esGMX``. The [harvestGmx](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L104C1-L111C6) function also sells GMX at a specified price.

Fee Management: 
- The contract has functionality for setting a fee recipient and withdrawing fees. Fees are collected in ``WETH`` and can be withdrawn by the fee recipient.

Staking and Vesting: 
- The contract has several ``private`` functions for handling staking and vesting. These include [_vestByGlp](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L253C4-L279C1), [_vestByEsGmx](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L280C1-L299C6), and [_stakeEsGmx](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L301C1-L314C6). These functions handle the logic for vesting tokens and staking ``esGMX``.

Withdrawal: 
- The [_withdraw](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L138C2-L152C6) function handles the withdrawal of tokens. It claims rewards, buys ``GLP``, and then transfers the specified amount to the recipient. It also handles vesting and staking.

Swap Callback: 
- The [uniswapV3SwapCallback](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies-audit/blob/master/contracts/glp/GlpStrategy.sol#L86C1-L95C1) function is used as a callback for Uniswap V3 swaps. It requires that the caller is the GMX/WETH pool and transfers the specified amount of GMX to the pool.

Overall Quality Assurance: 
The contract has several require statements to ensure that the contract is correctly configured and that operations are performed correctly. For example, it checks that the ``WETH`` address matches the ``WETH`` address from the GMX reward router, and that the GMX reward router and GLP reward router are correctly configured.

## No-8 

For the [YieldBox.sol](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol) contract: 

Modularity:
- The contract seems to be well-structured and modular. It inherits from multiple other contracts [(YieldBoxPermit, BoringBatchable, NativeTokenFactory, ERC721TokenReceiver, ERC1155TokenReceiver)](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L50C21-L50C116), which suggests a good separation of concerns.

Functionality: 
- The contract appears to be a yield box, allowing users to deposit assets and earn yield. It supports multiple types of tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and native tokens) and provides functions for depositing and withdrawing assets, transferring shares, and setting approval for operators.

Events: 
- Two events are declared: [Deposited](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L62C1-L72C7) and [Withdraw](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L74C2-L83C7). These events are emitted when a deposit or withdrawal operation is performed.

Constructor:
- The [constructor](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L91C4-L94C6) takes two parameters: [wrappedNative_](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L92C8-L92C40) and [uriBuilder_](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L93C8-L93C34). These are set as immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after the contract is deployed.

Functions: 
- The contract includes a variety of functions for depositing and withdrawing assets, transferring shares, setting approval for operators, and more. It also includes view functions for fetching information about assets and their shares.

Modifiers: 
- The contract uses a modifier ``allowed(from, assetId)`` to check if an operation is allowed for a specific user and asset.

Error Handling: 
- The contract uses require statements for error handling and to ensure the validity of operations.

Security: 
- The contract includes checks to prevent operations from or to the zero address, and to prevent approving the contract itself as an operator.

ERC721 and ERC1155 Compatibility: 
- The contract includes functions for handling both ERC721 (non-fungible tokens) and ERC1155 (multi-token standard) tokens.

Token Conversion: 
- The contract includes functions for converting between token amounts and shares.

Gas Optimization: 
- The contract uses the ``internal`` and ``external`` keywords to optimize gas usage.
